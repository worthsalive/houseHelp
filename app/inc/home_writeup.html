The world of information technology has gradually before our eyes turned the world into a global village, where the farthest place is accessible at the touch of a few buttons on a computer. Information Communication Technology (ICT) has made very powerful impacts on human activities. Examples of such are Universities registrations, registering professional courses like Cisco, applying for jobs, online schools etc., which were previously carried out through the manual system which consumes a lot of time and is very strenuous. As it stands now, the internet is an international network of computers connecting millions of people around the world. Government, Institutions, Universities, Colleges and Businesses etc., uses the internet every day for communication, entertainment, commerce, and education. In fact, the internet has become the most versatile and cheapest medium of communication and interaction among many people, organizations, institutions and businesses worldwide.
